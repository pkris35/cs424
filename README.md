# **Task 2 - Visualization Sketches and Domain Question Explanations** 

  

## **Sketch 1 (Domain Q1 – Scatter Plot with Regression Line)**   

This sketch plots individual points for each neighborhood with pollutant concentrations (e.g., PM₂.₅, NO₂) on the x-axis and health impacts (e.g., asthma emergency room visits) on the y-axis. A superimposed regression line shows the general dose–response trend. This visualization helps decision-makers quickly interpret correlations between pollution levels and health outcomes. 

  

## **Sketch 2 (Domain Q1 – Box Plot Comparison)**   

This visualization categorizes data into quartiles based on pollutant concentrations and represents corresponding health outcomes using box plots. It shifts the focus from individual data points to statistical distributions, highlighting potential pollution thresholds that exacerbate health issues. This method provides a broader perspective compared to the scatter plot. 

  

## **Sketch 3 (Domain Q2 – Time-Series Area Chart)**   

This area chart tracks the evolution of **boiler emissions (SO₂)** over time. The area under the curve represents the magnitude of emissions, and an additional semi-transparent overlay shows local **PM₂.₅ concentrations**. The visualization highlights emission trends, the impact of policy changes, and seasonal variations in air quality. 

  

## **Sketch 4 (Domain Q2 – Slope Graph)**   

A slope graph compares **boiler emissions before and after policy implementation** across different neighborhoods. Each line represents a location, and its slope indicates the magnitude and direction of emissions change. This concise visualization allows policymakers to quickly assess the impact of environmental policies on emissions. 

  

## **Sketch 5 (Domain Q3 – Grouped Bar Chart)**   

This grouped bar chart displays **vehicle miles traveled (VMT)** alongside **pollutant concentrations (NO₂, PM₂.₅)** for different neighborhoods. By positioning the bars side by side for each location, this visualization provides a clear comparison of transportation activity and its contribution to pollution levels. 

  

## **Sketch 6 (Domain Q3 – Lollipop Chart)**   

A lollipop chart presents the same data as the grouped bar chart but in a cleaner, more minimalist form. Neighborhoods are plotted along a pollution concentration axis, and each "lollipop" marker is color-coded and sized according to **vehicle miles traveled**. This format reduces visual clutter while effectively communicating traffic-related pollution trends. 

  

## **Sketch 7 (Domain Q4 – Heat Map)**   

A heat map represents **seasonal pollutant trends** across different locations. **Seasons are arranged as rows, pollutant types as columns, and the color intensity indicates concentration levels.** This visualization helps policymakers identify seasonal pollution peaks and develop targeted mitigation strategies. 

  

## **Sketch 8 (Domain Q4 – Bump Chart)**   

A bump chart tracks how different neighborhoods rank in terms of **seasonal pollutant concentrations** over time. Each colored line represents a neighborhood, with its position shifting across seasons to indicate relative changes in pollution levels. This approach helps highlight seasonal air quality fluctuations across locations. 

   

## **1. What are the most and least polluted locations in a given region?**   

This visualization uses **expressive faces** to indicate pollution levels—**a sad face for highly polluted locations and a happy face for the cleanest areas**. The **color of each face represents the dominant pollutant**, allowing for quick identification of both pollution severity and its cause. This intuitive approach helps viewers emotionally engage with air quality data while ensuring clarity in regional pollution trends. 

  

## **2. Which pollutants have shown a rising or declining trend over the years?**   

A **circular bar chart (clock-style)** represents long-term pollution trends, with **each month arranged like numbers on a clock face**. Bars extend outward to indicate pollution levels, allowing for easy detection of **seasonal patterns and annual fluctuations**. This layout is particularly useful for identifying pollution cycles and evaluating the effectiveness of environmental policies. 

  

## **3. Are there any seasonal trends in pollution levels (e.g., higher in winter/summer)?**   

A **four-circle layout**, each representing a season, is used to display seasonal pollution trends. Each season contains **three bars**, corresponding to key pollutants, with their lengths representing concentration levels. **Arrows indicate seasonal shifts**, making it easy to visualize which pollutants dominate in specific seasons. 

  

## **4. Which pollutants are dominant in different regions and time periods?**   

A **bubble-based map visualization** represents dominant pollutants across different neighborhoods. Each **bubble's size corresponds to pollution concentration**, while its **color represents the pollutant type**. This map-based approach provides a geographical perspective on air quality, helping users pinpoint pollution hotspots and track changes over time. 

  

## **5. When do we see the most significant rise or drop in pollution for a given area?**   

This visualization uses a **combined line and bar chart** to display **pollution trends over multiple years**. The **line chart tracks pollutant levels over time**, while the **bar graph highlights significant spikes or drops** in specific years. This dual approach helps identify major environmental changes and policy impacts. 

  

## **6. Which pollutants are present in a given region?**   

A **hierarchical bubble chart** represents pollution composition within a region. **The largest bubbles correspond to regions, with smaller nested bubbles representing locations and their pollutants.** The **size of pollutant bubbles indicates their concentration**, making it easy to compare different pollutants across locations. 

 
## **Abstract Task Analysis for Air Quality Questions** 

  

Using **Brehmer & Munzner’s task typology**, we translate the domain questions into abstract tasks by analyzing why users perform these tasks, what data they interact with, and how they engage with it.

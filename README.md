#### UHF42 Boiler Emissions Choropleth

This choropleth map shows average boiler emissions across UHF42 regions in NYC. The regions are filled based on emission intensity, with darker shades representing higher values. The geometry is reprojected to Web Mercator for consistent rendering, and tooltips reveal the region name and exact emission level on hover. This map provides a static but clear spatial baseline for observing emission concentration patterns across healthcare zones.

#### UHF42 Annual Vehicle Miles Traveled 

This interactive choropleth shows the total miles traveled by vehicles across NYCâ€™s UHF42 regions. A dropdown allows switching between total vehicle miles, truck miles, and car miles. The map is color-encoded to represent mileage intensity, where warmer colors indicate regions with higher vehicle activity. Tooltips reveal the region name and exact values in millions of miles.

#### NYC Hospitalization Rates by UHF42 Region (Dropdown)

This choropleth map displays hospitalization rates per 100,000 residents across UHF42 regions in NYC. A dropdown menu allows users to switch between multiple health conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses for both adults and children. The map uses a color gradient to represent hospitalization intensity, and tooltips provide region-level values and population group context on hover.

#### Community District (CD) and UHF42 Air Pollutants (Horizontal Comparison)

This side-by-side choropleth visualization compares pollutant concentrations (PM2.5,NO2 and O3) across two geographic levels: Community District (CD) and UHF42. Dropdown menus let users select the pollutant of interest for each map independently. This layout allows for easy spatial comparison across granularity levels, helping reveal whether patterns in fine-scale (CD) data align with broader regional patterns (UHF42). Tooltips show pollutant type, district/region name, and concentration values.

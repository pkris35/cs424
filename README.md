Explanation for Question 1: "What are the most and least polluted locations in a given region?"
The visualization represents the most and least polluted locations using two expressive facesâ€”a sad face for the most polluted location and a happy face for the least polluted location. The color of each face corresponds to the dominant pollutant in that area, allowing viewers to quickly identify both pollution severity and its primary cause.

This design effectively communicates air quality disparities in an intuitive and engaging way. The use of expressive faces makes the visualization instantly relatable, helping users emotionally connect with the data. Additionally, color coding ensures that different pollutants can be easily distinguished, enabling policymakers and environmental researchers to pinpoint pollution sources and take appropriate action.
